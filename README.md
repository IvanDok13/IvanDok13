I am a researcher scientist with a Master`s degree, with 7 years work experiens in laser tech. For two years I'm passionate about software development.

I enjoy coming up with new ideas, building new projects. I'm always learning new technologies, frameworks, and libraries. I really love algoritmic tasks on codewars.

Most of my work finds direct industrial applications. I am currently . 


I enjoy taking cool ideas and turning them into powerful practical outcomes. 

I am currently looking for my next opportunity so please reach out. 


Worked in related fields as: research associate, optical mechanic, engineer, technician. Interacted with the quality control department, testing laboratories, mechanical section, communicated with suppliers, was engaged in product refinement. I want to develop in the field of instrumentation.

I have been interested in computers since childhood. I have worked with almost all known brands of laptops. I can figure out and fix most household appliances and devices. I am a very active person, so I value every free minute and try to manage my time wisely. I can read technical documentation, wrote articles and communicate in English.

Hello. I have experience in the aerospace industry. I assembled and tested laser emitters to ensure they met the requirements for tightness, temperature conditions etc. I have extensive experience working with high-precision instruments, beam profile analyzers and other devices. I think I am ideally suited for this position since I have spent a lot of time practicing fine-tuning laser emitters, grinding optics and assembling small units and entire products.

After receiving my Master's degree in Laser Engineering and Laser Technology, I worked as a researcher in the field of laser engineering for 7 years. I have extensive experience in conducting experiments, observing and writing reports. In addition, I am interested in contributing to the described research and preserving the cultural heritage of mankind. For this reason, I believe that I am a perfect match for the requirements of the vacancy.

I prefer work from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. I am flexible, 

love for programming, motivating a team and maintaining life balance

I use React in some projects. In my opinion, it is the best way to create more complex and powerful applications with many lines of code. With this framework, the code is easier to write and you can optimize such tasks as code duplication, creating a single-page application or several similar buttons.

respectful attitude towards other people's code, hints on how to fix this or that error, before correcting someone find out whether there really is an error.

A good pull request has a clear title that reflects the changes. A detailed and well-written description. It should contain a small number of changes related to a single feature. It should be covered by tests to ensure that it does not break functionality or introduce new bugs. It should also adhere to the standard adopted by the team or company.

A good pull request thus facilitates quick merges and facilitates review by other participants.

A bad PR makes it difficult for other participants to accept the changes. It is misleading, contains errors, violates established standards, and can negatively affect the work of the entire project.

VSCode I really like this IDE because it has very broad support, there are many convenient extensions and settings. Linter ESLint and formatter Prettier because they make coding and debugging much easier. VITE because it is much more convenient and understandable than other builders. Sometimes I use AI to find the most interesting version of the code, edit the text, get an answer to my question and get out of the stupor

I have an apple macbook air m1. I have a powerful wifi router at home that works on 6G technology.
I can also share the internet from my phone. I am willing to change the computer and improve the internet connection for work.

I expect a salary of $5,000. Maybe I didn't fully understand the compensation question

If hired, will I be able to work from the U.S. office occasionally? I want to communicate with my colleagues
